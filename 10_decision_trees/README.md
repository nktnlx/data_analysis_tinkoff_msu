The notebook contains python code to solve home-tasks from the [Data Analysis Course](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_tinkoff_msu) for Moscow State University students by Tinkoff Education 2021 I've enrolled in March 2021.   



Used decision trees (Random Forest Classifier) to predict an advanced repayment of credit with help of scikit-learn machine learning library.

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
