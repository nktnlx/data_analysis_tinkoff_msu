Hi there!


I'm learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by mid of 2021.  

This repository is for Open [Data Analysis Course](https://fintech.tinkoff.ru/study/academy/analysis/) for Moscow State University Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics students by Tinkoff Education 2021. I have been taken this course in March--May 2021. Notebooks include my code and solutions for home-tasks and projects of the course.  




**Course curriculum:**  
1. SQL  
2. Data Visualization in Python  
3. A/B tests (part 1)  
4. A/B tests (part 2)  
5. A/B tests (part 3)  
6. Data Interpretation  
7. Mobile Analytics
8. Logistic regression  
9. Models    
10. Random forest    


  


Hope this repo will help you to assess my SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
