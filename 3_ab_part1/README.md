The notebook contains python code to solve home-tasks from the [Data Analysis Course](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_tinkoff_msu) for Moscow State University students by Tinkoff Education 2021 I've enrolled in March 2021.   



Formulated Null and Alternative hypothesis, performed four A/B tests (code for data simulation and making conclusion), defined the minimum sample size for A/B test using [AB Testguide calculator](https://abtestguide.com/abtestsize/).  

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
